"""
Module for planning safe and efficient tool paths.

This module calculates optimal tool paths, including safe approaches,
efficient movement sequences, and proper clearance planes to avoid collisions
while minimizing machining time.

Functions:
    plan_drilling_sequence(drilling_points): Orders drilling operations efficiently
    calculate_safe_approach(point, tool_data): Determines safe approach path
    optimize_path(points): Optimizes path for minimal tool movement
    generate_clearance_moves(points, tool_data): Creates moves at safe clearance height
