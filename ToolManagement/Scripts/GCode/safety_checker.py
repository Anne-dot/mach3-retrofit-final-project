"""
Module for implementing safety constraints in G-code.

This module implements the safety requirements defined in the knowledge base,
ensuring that generated G-code follows all safety constraints for different
tool types and prevents unsafe operations.

Functions:
    add_safety_checks(gcode, tool_data): Adds safety checks to G-code
    validate_movement(tool_type, direction, movement): Validates movement safety
    check_tool_constraints(tool_params, operation): Checks operation against tool constraints
    generate_safe_z_heights(tool_data, workpiece): Calculates safe Z heights
