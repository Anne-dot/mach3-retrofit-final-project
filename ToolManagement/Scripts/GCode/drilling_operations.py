"""
Module for generating specialized horizontal drilling G-code.

This module creates the specific G-code sequences needed for horizontal
drilling operations, including approach movements, dwelling, retraction,
and safety positioning.

Functions:
    generate_horizontal_drill(point, direction, depth): Creates drilling operation G-code
    calculate_approach_position(point, direction): Determines approach coordinates
    generate_dwell_command(time): Creates dwell command for chip clearing
    generate_retract_move(point, direction): Creates retraction movement
