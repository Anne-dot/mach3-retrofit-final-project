"""
Module for geometric calculations and transformations.

This module provides pure geometric functions for calculating distances,
angles, intersections, and other mathematical operations needed for
processing DXF data and preparing it for G-code generation.

Functions:
    calculate_distance(point1, point2): Calculates distance between points
    calculate_angle(line1, line2): Calculates angle between lines
    find_intersection(line1, line2): Finds intersection point of two lines
    is_point_inside_boundary(point, boundary): Checks if point is inside boundary
    convert_arc_to_points(arc, resolution): Converts arc to discrete points
