Module for extracting tool requirements from DXF files.

This module analyzes DXF entities to determine the required tools for machining
operations, with focus on identifying the appropriate tools for horizontal
drilling based on hole diameters and other specifications.

Functions:
    determine_required_tools(dxf_doc): Identifies all tools needed
    match_hole_to_tool(hole_diameter): Matches hole size to appropriate tool
    extract_tool_parameters(dxf_doc): Extracts special tool requirements
    validate_tool_availability(required_tools): Checks if needed tools exist
