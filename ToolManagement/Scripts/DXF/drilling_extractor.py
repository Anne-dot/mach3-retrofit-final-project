Module for identifying and extracting horizontal drilling data from DXF files.

This module locates horizontal drilling points, determines their depths,
directions, and other parameters needed for generating proper G-code for
horizontal drilling operations.

Functions:
    find_drilling_points(dxf_doc): Locates all drilling points in the drawing
    determine_drilling_direction(point, entities): Identifies drilling direction
    extract_drilling_depth(point, entities): Determines required drilling depth
    group_drilling_operations(points): Groups related drilling operations
