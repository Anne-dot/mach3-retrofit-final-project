"""
Module for extracting workpiece geometry from DXF files.

This module identifies and extracts the workpiece boundaries, dimensions,
and orientation from DXF files. It provides the physical properties of the
stock material needed for proper machining operations.

Functions:
    extract_workpiece_boundaries(dxf_doc): Extracts outer boundaries of workpiece
    calculate_dimensions(boundaries): Determines width, height, and depth
    identify_orientation(dxf_doc): Determines workpiece orientation
    get_reference_points(dxf_doc): Extracts reference points for machining
