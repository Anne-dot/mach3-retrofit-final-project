"""
Module for coordinate system transformations and conversions.

This module handles conversions between different coordinate systems,
including DXF coordinates to machine coordinates, and provides utilities
for working with offsets and reference points.

Functions:
    dxf_to_machine_coords(point, reference): Converts DXF to machine coordinates
    apply_offset(point, offset): Applies an offset to coordinates
    rotate_point(point, angle, center): Rotates a point around center
    transform_coordinate_system(points, matrix): Applies transformation matrix
    calculate_safe_positions(points, tool_data): Calculates safe approach positions
